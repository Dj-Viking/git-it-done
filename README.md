# Git-It-Done

## Description
- Using the GitHub RESTful API this application can display the repositories of any user that can be found using the search function.
- It is also possible to display the repositories that are tagged with a particular language
- This will also display the repositories that currently have issues or pull-requests
- Clicking on the repository opens a new page which shows all the issues/pull-requests relating to that repository
- PLEASE NOTE there is only a maximum amount of 30 repositories that can be displayed at a time on this page using the RESTful API call, the same applies to how many issues/pull-requests that can be displayed (only 30 at a time)
- There is a direct link to the repository on the second page to view more than 30 issues/pull-requests
